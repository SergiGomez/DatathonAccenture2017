# DatathonAccenture2017
Machine Learning model used in the Datathon held by Accenture in 2017

For those who want to fork this repository, let me please reinforce the fact that the full code was made during a Datathon event, which consisted of a weekend of coding to build a predictive model whose accuracy had to beat the other teams' accuracy. Having said that, I should warn people using the code that some bugs might come out when developing it further. My team and I did great efforts to leave the code clean and neat, but due to the nature of the event, we had to wrote it very fast before the submission deadline would ring the bell.

We tried different models and the ones who proved to be the most performant were those from H20 (www.h2o.ai/products/h2o/). At first I was a bit skeptical about H20 as I thought that it would take way too long for training a decent model, but it definitely proved me wrong, it worked so well! I have used it quite a few times since, so I encourage anyone reading that to use H20 at some point in your data science projects. 

Over the weekend we also came up with some different features, but one of them was a very special one, it moved us up to the 3rd position right away (guess which that feature was!). It was a great experience overall, we ended up being the 3rd team in the leaderboard, but we won the best app prize thanks to the business case that we elaborated around the predictive model. 

Just as a final word, this was my first Data Science competition and I keep a great souvenir, thanks Accenture for organizing it!
